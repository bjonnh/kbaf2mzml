* An ultrafast Bruker BAF to MzMl converter.


This is highly experimental so there is no documentation yet.

It seems that we can achieve a conversion in 1 to 2 seconds of a 200M BAF file (with MS1 and MS2).

There is a lot left to do for it to be really usable.

The purpose is NOT to make it a feature complete converter for every instrument, this is an
internal tool that we are sharing the code if someone find any use to it.

** Adapter for windows

You can cross-build for windows on linux. You will need to install mingw64 and put the JDK in stuff/ then update
build_adapter.h

We are giving you an already made DLL to make process easier as it can be painful.
